Gladys Mae West, born on October 27, 1930, in Sutherland, Virginia, is a pioneering mathematician whose work significantly contributed to the development of the Global Positioning System (GPS). After earning her Bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Virginia State College in 1952 and a Master’s degree in 1955, she began her career at the U.S. Naval Proving Ground, where she developed mathematical models that accurately represented the Earth's shape, essential for GPS technology. 

Gladys West is often referred to as one of the "hidden figures" in the history of NASA and military technology, West's contributions went largely unrecognized for many years. In 2018, she was inducted into the United States Air Force Hall of Fame and named one of the BBC's 100 Women, highlighting her legacy in STEM and inspiring future generations, particularly women of color, to pursue careers in science and technology.

Ms. West will serve as one of many examples to guide our questions about teaching mathematics and science. Please watch the below video to help frame your historical analysis assignment.
