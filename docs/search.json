The schedule is divided into three main phases: observation (weeks 1-4), support and individual tutoring (weeks 5-6), and mini-lessons and whole class activities (weeks 7-10). This structure will allow you to gradually build your skills and confidence in supporting mathematics instruction, moving from passive observation to active teaching. Each week focuses on a specific aspect of math instruction or student interaction.\nTo maximize the benefits of your field placement, you are required to maintain a detailed field placement log. This log should track all the information outlined in the third column of the schedule below. Your log entries should include the date, specific observation notes, reflections on teaching strategies, notes on student interactions, and your personal growth throughout the experience. Pay particular attention to documenting the progression of your involvement, from initial observations to leading class activities. This log will serve as a valuable resource for your professional development, helping you identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. Additionally, it will provide concrete examples and experiences to draw upon during future job interviews or when developing your teaching philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nMain Task\nSuggestions\n\n\n\n\n1\nObserve class routines\nTake notes on your cooperating teacher’s strategies and differences in student engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nObserve math instruction techniques\nFocus on questioning the classroom strategies and differentiation methods.

After earning her Bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Virginia State College in 1952 and a Master’s degree in 1955, she began her career at the U.S. Naval Proving Ground, where she developed mathematical models that accurately represented the Earth’s shape, essential for GPS technology.\nGladys West is often referred to as one of the “hidden figures” in the history of NASA and military technology, West’s contributions went largely unrecognized for many years. In 2018, she was inducted into the United States Air Force Hall of Fame and named one of the BBC’s 100 Women, highlighting her legacy in STEM and inspiring future generations, particularly women of color, to pursue careers in science and technology.\nMs. West will serve as one of many examples to guide our questions about teaching mathematics and science.

    "text": "This page provides language for your cooperating teacher along with information for you both to review related to the expectations of your field placement.\n\nWelcome Letter for Cooperating Teachers\nDear Teacher Colleagues,\nThank you for partnering in our EDUC 315 mathematics field experience.\nWe are thankful for your support in helping to shape the next generation of Howard University prepared educators. This 8- to 10-week field placement is designed to provide our students with a comprehensive classroom experience. We ask for your support in guiding them through observations, one-on-one tutoring, and eventually leading a lesson or activities.\nYour mentoring will be invaluable as our pre-service teachers progress from observers to active participants in your classroom. We appreciate your willingness to share your expertise, provide constructive feedback, and create opportunities for our students to apply their learning.\nPlease review the field experience expectations below. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact our field placement coordinator, Dr. Renix, or me, Dr. Nathan Alexander (the instructor for the course).\nThank you again for your commitment to teacher education.\nWarm regards, Prof. Alexander\n\n\nField Log Expectations\nOur future teachers are required to maintain a detailed field experience log throughout their placement. This log serves as a reflective tool and a record of your growth, so they may be taking notes during their time in your classroom. Here are some general expectations for their log:\n\nRegular notes: Make entries during or after each field experience session.\nContent: Include detailed observations, reflections on teaching strategies, notes on student interactions, and personal growth insights. NO student names or personal information should be included.\nStructure: Organize log by date and align entries with the weekly tasks and suggestions provided in the schedule here.\nReflection: Include thoughts on what is learned, questions that arise, and ideas for future implementation in your own teaching.\nConnections: Draw links between your observations and the educational theories and methods from class.\nSpecificity: Provide concrete examples and avoid generalizations. Here, you may use pseudonyms or numbers (e.g., student 1, student 2) to protect student privacy.\nProfessional Growth: Document your progression from observer to active teacher, noting challenges and successes along the way.\n\nYour field experience log will be reviewed periodically by Professor Alexander and will form part of your overall assessment for the course. The field experience log is due at the end of the semester.\n\n\nAttendance Expectations\nConsistent attendance is necessary for a meaningful field experience, please read these expectations:\n\nDuration and total hours: The field placement consists of a 3 hours per week for 8-10 weeks, for a total of 30 hours.\nScheduling: Work with your cooperating teacher to establish a regular schedule that fits both your needs and the classroom’s schedule.\nPunctuality: Arrive at least 10 minutes before your scheduled time to prepare for the day’s activities.\nAbsences: If you must miss a scheduled session due to illness or emergency, notify both your cooperating teacher and Dr. Alexander via email as soon as possible. Arrange to make up any missed time.\nProfessionalism: Treat this experience as you would a job. Dress professionally and adhere to the school’s policies and procedures.\nDocumentation: Record your attendance in your field experience log, including dates, times, and hours completed.\nCompletion: You must complete all 20 hours to receive credit for the field placement. Any shortfall in hours must be made up before the end of the semester.",

For example, for the same set \\(A = \\{1, 3, 5\\}\\), we write \\(6 \\notin A\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubsets\n\n\n\nA set \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\) if every element of \\(A\\) is also in \\(B\\).\nWe write \\(A \\subseteq B\\) to indicate subsets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations\n\n\n\n\nUnion\nThe union of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the set of all elements in \\(A\\) or \\(B\\):\n\\[\nA \\cup B = \\{ x \\mid x \\in A \\text{ or } x \\in B \\}\n\\]\n\n\nIntersection\nThe intersection of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the set of all elements in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n\\[\nA \\cap B = \\{ x \\mid x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B \\}\n\\]\n\n\nComplement\nThe complement of set \\(A\\) (relative to a universal set \\(U\\)) is the set of all elements in \\(U\\) not in \\(A\\):\n\\[\nA^{c} = \\{ x \\in U \\mid x \\notin A \\}\n\\]",

    "text": "Framing mathematics and science\nScience is the systematic study and pursuit of knowledge about the natural and physical world through observation, experimentation, and the formulation of testable hypotheses. It involves a methods-based approach to understanding phenomena and developing explanations based on empirical evidence. Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of quantity, structure, space, and change.\n\n\nLogic\nLogic refers to the principles of reasoning, especially correct reasoning. It’s the systematic method of coming to conclusions through rational thought. In mathematics, logic involves the formal principles of reasoning and inference used to derive valid conclusions.\n\n\nReasoning\n\nDeductive reasoning: Deductive reasoning is a logical process that involves drawing specific conclusions from general premises or principles that are assumed to be true. This form of reasoning is often described as a “top-down” approach, where one starts with a general statement and applies it to a specific case. In mathematics, deductive reasoning involves using established rules, facts, and theorems to draw specific conclusions. It moves from general principles to specific instances.\nInductive reasoning: Inductive reasoning is a logical process that involves drawing general conclusions from specific observations or instances. This method is often referred to as “bottom-up” reasoning, contrasting with deductive reasoning, which moves from general principles to specific conclusions. In mathematics, inductive reasoning involves observing patterns or specific instances to form general conclusions or hypotheses.\nUsing if-then statements.\n\n\n\nQuantity\nQuantity relates to the amount or number of something that can be measured or counted. In mathematics, it deals with concepts like magnitude, size, or amount that can be expressed numerically.\n\n\nStructure\nStructure in mathematics refers to the way mathematical objects are organized or arranged. It involves the relationships and patterns between mathematical entities, such as the properties of number systems or the organization of geometric shapes.\n\n\nSpace\nIn mathematics, space refers to the framework within which points, lines, shapes, and other geometric objects exist. It can be two-dimensional (like a plane), three-dimensional (like our physical world), or even higher-dimensional in abstract mathematics.\n\n\nChange\nChange in mathematics deals with how quantities or properties vary or transform over time or under different conditions. This concept is fundamental to areas like calculus, which studies rates of change and accumulation.",

Umoja’s curriculum begins with a holistic approach, bringing spirit, body, and cultural memory into the learning environments we cultivate for our students and community of practitioners. When students, faculty, and staff attend Umoja’s symposia, institutes, and conferences, they build communal intelligence around identity, culture, career growth, manifestation, and leadership. We draw from educators like bell hooks, Dr. Asa G. Hilliard, Dr. Bettina Love, and Dr. Wade Nobles to uplift the important role of culture, love, and justice in the Umoja classroom and program. We recommend aligning programs, coursework, field trips, etc. to at least one of the goals or objectives from Umoja’s Curriculum.\n Find more information by clicking here"

From 2011-2014, teachers received ongoing training in Common Core implementation, with full implementation occurring during the 2014-15 school year.\nThe CCSS-Mathematics demand a shift in math instruction from an emphasis on procedural fluency towards a balance between procedural fluency, conceptual understanding and application of concepts, so students are better prepared for the critical thinking necessary to succeed in college, careers and their daily lives.
