STEM skills and knowledge are not only valuable components to a solid academic program, but also core fundamentals for life experience. STEM skills and knowledge help students develop logic, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills that can be used in every discipline and that enable them to compete in the continually growing high-tech job sector. As such, DC strives to improve STEM opportunities for all its students and has established the following statewide goals for STEM:\nGoal 1: To prepare all students in DC to graduate high school with a college- and career-ready mastery of math, science, engineering and technology\nGoal 2: To increase the number of DC students who major in STEM fields in college and enter STEM careers\nFind more information by clicking here",

The historical figure should showcase the growing diversity of a host of identities, cultures, and backgrounds represented in STEM.\nProcedures\n\nMuseum visit (75 minutes): Smithsonian Museum exhibit. Please take notes on interesting STEM figures and exhibits.\nFigure selection and background research: Choose a historical STEM figure based on museum inspiration. Conduct additional research using archival resources and online databases.\nContent creation: Students create content about their chosen figure in one of the following formats: Detailed video presentation (e.g., Tiktoc), Visual infographic (e.g., Canva), Interactive digital timeline, Podcast-like episode, Digital exhibit\nPeer review: Students your work with classmates for feedback. Make final adjustments based on peer feedback.\nPresentation (5 minutes): Develop a 5-minute presentation in the style that you would present it to your student. Present finished content to the class as if you were in front of your future students.\n\n\n\n\nImage from rif.org"

    "text": "Gladys West\n\n\nGladys Mae West, born on October 27, 1930, in Sutherland, Virginia, is a pioneering mathematician whose work significantly contributed to the development of the Global Positioning System (GPS). After earning her Bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Virginia State College in 1952 and a Master’s degree in 1955, she began her career at the U.S. Naval Proving Ground, where she developed mathematical models that accurately represented the Earth’s shape, essential for GPS technology.\nGladys West is often referred to as one of the “hidden figures” in the history of NASA and military technology, West’s contributions went largely unrecognized for many years. In 2018, she was inducted into the United States Air Force Hall of Fame and named one of the BBC’s 100 Women, highlighting her legacy in STEM and inspiring future generations, particularly women of color, to pursue careers in science and technology.\nMs. West will serve as one of many examples to guide our questions about teaching mathematics and science.

The emphasis on problem-solving strategies gained momentum in the 1980s, with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) highlighting its importance in their standards. Since then, various approaches have been developed to enhance students’ problem-solving skills, including heuristic strategies, metacognitive techniques, and collaborative problem-solving.\nWho is George Polya?\nGeorge Polya (1887-1985) was a Hungarian mathematician who made significant contributions to various fields of mathematics. He is best known for his work on problem-solving, particularly his book “How to Solve It” (1945), which outlines a systematic approach to problem-solving.\nPolya’s problem-solving approach consists of four main steps:\n\nUnderstand the problem: This step involves carefully reading the problem, identifying key information, and clarifying any unfamiliar terms or concepts.\nDevise a plan: Here, the problem-solver considers various strategies and selects an appropriate approach. This may include drawing diagrams, looking for patterns, or working backwards.\nCarry out the plan: In this step, the chosen strategy is implemented, and calculations are performed. It’s important to check each step for accuracy[2].\nLook back: After obtaining a solution, the problem-solver reviews their work, verifies the result, and considers alternative methods or extensions of the problem[2].\n\nExample 1: Solve the equation 2x + 5 = 13\n\nUnderstand: We need to find the value of x that makes the equation true.\nPlan: Isolate x by subtracting 5 from both sides, then divide by 2.\nExecute: 2x + 5 = 13 2x = 8 x = 4\nLook back: Check if 2(4) + 5 = 13, which it does.\n\nExample 2: Find the area of a rectangle with perimeter 24 cm and length 3 cm longer than its width.\n\nUnderstand: We need to find the area, given the perimeter and a relationship between length and width.\nPlan: Let w be the width. Express length as w + 3. Use the perimeter formula to find w, then calculate the area.\nExecute: 2(w + (w + 3)) = 24 4w + 6 = 24 4w = 18 w = 4.5 cm length = 7.5 cm Area = 4.5 × 7.5 = 33.75 cm²\nLook back: Verify that the perimeter is indeed 24 cm and the length is 3 cm longer than the width."
