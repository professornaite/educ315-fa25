# Course description

This course provides candidates with knowledge, skills, dispositions and pedagogy to deliver content-rich, rigorous mathematics and science instruction for African American and diverse urban learners in grades 4 â€“ 6. Candidates will have opportunities to employ a variety of instructional strategies to integrate mathematics and science content and the Common Core State Standards through the Principles of Learning Mathematics and Science. Field-based experiences provide an opportunity for candidates to design, develop and implement evidence-based lessons in science and mathematics.

This course has a particular emphasis on learning mathematics in K-6 school settings.

# Course goals

- This course will explore how we understand our dual identities as learners of mathematics and as teachers of mathematics (and quantification) in a society that, broadly, has had adverse experiences with mathematics.

- This could will focus on how we can develop a good understanding of the principles of logical reasoning and explore how mathematical language shapes our thinking about different real-world scenarios and applications.

- This course will allow us to develop our skills to analyze and construct mathematical arguments, and to connect logic to real-world teaching and learning scenarios.

- This course will support your thinking about how to develop lessons and unit-plans that support the above priorities: exploring how we understand oursevles and others as mathematical people, developing a good understandign of logic and mathemtical language, and developing our skills to create lessons that construct mathematical arguments to a diverse set of scenaiors and contexts.
