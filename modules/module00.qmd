# Course description

This course provides candidates with knowledge, skills, dispositions and pedagogy to deliver content-rich, rigorous mathematics and science instruction for African American and diverse urban learners in grades 4 – 6. Candidates will have opportunities to employ a variety of instructional strategies to integrate mathematics and science content and the Common Core State Standards through the Principles of Learning Mathematics and Science. Field-based experiences provide an opportunity for candidates to design, develop and implement evidence-based lessons in science and mathematics.

This course has a particular emphasis on learning mathematics in K-6 school settings.

# Course goals

- Understand mathematics as both learners and teachers, and reflect on how personal and societal experiences shape our views of math.

- Build skills in logical reasoning and mathematical language, and explore how they shape thinking, communication, and instruction.  

- Learn to analyze and construct mathematical arguments and connect them to real teaching and learning scenarios.  

- Design lessons and unit plans that:  
  - Support students’ identities as mathematical thinkers  
  - Emphasize logical reasoning and conceptual understanding  
  - Integrate mathematics with science and Common Core standards  
  - Use varied strategies to reach diverse learners in grades 4–6  
  
- Apply learning in field experiences by creating and evaluating evidence-based lessons that combine math, science, and culturally responsive pedagogy.
