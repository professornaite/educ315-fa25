The pages on this site outline the technical components of EDUC 315: Principles of Teaching Mathematics and Science in Urban Classrooms II at Howard University, taught by [Professor Nathan Alexander](https://professornaite.github.io){target="_blank"}. This site will serve as a <u>companion</u> to our [Canvas site](https://canvas.howard.edu/courses/61566){target="_blank"}, support you with questions relevant to teaching mathematics, and support your development of a pedagogical praxis for your future classroom.
